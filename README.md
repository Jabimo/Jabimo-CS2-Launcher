# Jabimo-s-CS2-Launcher
<b>What is the purpose of this software?</b>
<br>The purpose is to make it easier to play fullscreen-windowed with the desired aspect ratio (4:3, 16:9, 16:10) and resolution 
<br>without having to change the resolution of your monitor manually everytime you open CS2.</br> I personally don't like fullscreen in CS2, because you can't tab on your second monitor without the game minimizing. 
<br>However by using fullscreen-windowed you are able to do exactly this.</br>
<br>
<b>Is it safe to use?</b>
<br>Yes this software are by no means modifying any files related to CS2 and it tells steam to run CS2 just like when you open CS2 yourself. Therefore you CAN'T get VAC-BAN by using this software.</br>
<br>
<b>How does it work?</b>
<br>First time you open the launcher, it will open a GUI. In this GUI you are able to choose your desired aspect ratio and resolution. 
<br>Then you also have the option to save the resolution, so that you don't have to choose the resolution again next time that you open the launcher.</br>
<br>
When confirming that the chosen resolution is fine, it will open CS2 through steam and change the resolution of your monitor to the chosen resolution. 
It doesn't change the resolution of the game. You have to manually set the game setting to fullscreen-windowed if not already set.
Because when using fullscreen-windowed it basically uses the aspect ratio, resolution and refresh rate set in your monitor.</br> 

Then when it is time to take a break from CS2 and you want to close the game, it will change the resolution of your monitor back to native resolution.

<b>Does it change the refresh rate of your monitor?</b>
<br>No don't worry. You will still be playing at the refresh rate that you have always used (60 Hz, 144 Hz, 240 Hz etc.).</br>
<br>
<b>What if I want to use a new resolution?</b>
<br>Then you will have to delete the config file. It is being stored at the following location AppData/Local/JabimoCS2Launcher 
<br>You can find the folder by searching %localappdata% in the search field in Windows.</br>
<br>
<b>What if I want to run CS2 through my steam library?</b>
<br>You can add this launcher to your steam library to be able to do this. 
<br>Simply click "Add a game". It should be located at the bottom left of your steam library.</br>
Then choose add a non steam game and then click browse to locate the executable launcher.
<br>I recommend to have the launcher on your desktop so it is easy to locate and add to your steam library.</br>
